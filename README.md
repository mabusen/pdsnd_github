bikeshare.py

This is a project that was part of the programming for data science with python nanodegree. It's a script that analyze bikeshare data and allows a user to analyze this data by interacting with the terminal.

We're using three csv files:
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

The udacity course as well as the python documentation helped me writing this scricpt.
